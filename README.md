In this project, we use deep convolutional networks to examine the predictability in the financial market. The outcome is expected to structure a decision support framework which can be used by traders with the suggestion on indications of future market. The historical data from the financial market can be converted to graphical charts, which can be supplied as the input for training the models. This framework can be used to analyse the patterns inside the financial chart and predict the future movements of the market. Besides, we develop efficient trading algorithms based on the deep learning models.
